		<h2> 3. Purpose, goals and audience </h2>
		<p>	The plan is just tentative. There may be some major and minor changes during the process of design. We&#39re keeping our options free so that we may add or change our work on the spot. Over the time we may find other solutions which could work better, or we may discover some functionalities that our webpage could possibly lack, as we progress our work. The following is what we decided our solution should contain: 
		The site will contain contact information and directions, opening hours, menus, free working positions, news section, picture section with social medias. 
		The site will be sectioned into a front page which will contain a logo with a slogan (main menu) and this will be kept the same throughout the whole navigation process
		The menus will consist of a food menu,	&quotabout us&quot section (the company), picture gallery, contact information, comment section, &quotfree working positions&quot section and &quotsocial medias&quotsection.</p>

		<h2> 4. Navigation Structure </h2>
		
			<p> The navigation structure of SuperHero website can be described as
			clique, and it is shown in Figure 1. From the homepage, it is possible to access
			 all of the pages included in the website, and vice versa, it is 
			 possible to access the homepage from every page through the use of a 
			 roll-over menu. Though not visible until hovered upon, the links for
			 each web page are included within every page. </p>
			 
			 <p>In the Search part they can search any news and information they want, In the Contac us we provide evry detail e.g address mail and 
			 even delivery options. In the About us we provide every detail about the Super Hero. In the Best offers part we show the week best offer which clients can buy that meal cheaper than other things.In our Menue they can search for every thing that our menue includes in it </p>

		<h2> 6. Content </h2>
		
		<p>There will be nine separate pages as follows:</p>
      <ol>
<li>Homepage-<em>homepage.html</em> 
		   <p> When you visit our website, the first page you will see is the homepage. Our goal with the homepage is to make it look professional and easily naviagated. The homepage will be a background with their logo on it and an introduction to their website and restaurant. We want users that hasn't yet visited the restaurant to become even more interested after seeing our site, and the first impression with the homepage is very important to that. Most of the traffick we assume will be from previous customers that want to check the opening and closing, and people that want to see the menu. So we have to make the site seem easily navigated as people might give up if they dont find what theyre looking for on the first try. </p>
		      <img src="Images/home.png" alt="mockup for homepage" width="550">
			  <figcaption>Figure 3: Mockup for homepage.html</figcaption>
		   </figure>
		   
		<li>About-<em>about.html</em>
           <p> The "About" page of the site will give brief information of the restaurant, their food and their history. It's designed to give the users information about Superhero Burger, such as when they started their business, what the restaurant looks like, their slogans etc. The page will help already going customers knowing more about their favorite restaurant.

		   </figure>
		   
        <li>Day's Offer-<em>daysoffer.html</em>
		   <p>The Day's Menu is the page which will showcase which meal is their speciality of the day. It will show which meal is recommended from the owners. We will make a page that is very tasteful and will showcase the food in a manner which will hopefully make the user more hungry and want to visit the restaurant. By having a page like this there will always be someone, if the traffick is great enough, that will get tempted by a picture of a delicious burger. This page will in other words be for advertising purposes and to attract more people by making them hungry </p>

		   </figure>
		   
	    <li>Our Menu<em>ourmenu.html</em>
		   <p>We will divide the menu page(s) into three categories; Burgers, Drinks and Extras. There will be every information you need about each part of the menu, divided into three to make it easier to read and navigate to what youre looking for. In the Burgers part it will say the name of each burger, its price, its components and its allergens. Drinks and Extras will simply give you the name of every drink they have and its price. The extras will give information about what else the shop has to offer, from extra burgers or cheese to chips and dip, aswell as a childrens menu.</p>

		   </figure>
		   <li>Contact<em>contact.html</em>
        	<p> The "Contact" page will vive the users information about the restaurants contactinformation, such as their phonenumber, their emailaddress and facebookpage. It's very important for all restaurants to be easy accessible to the public, so giving the information to whomever needs it is the main goal of this page. We will put the email and phonenumber very visible and be the first things you see when you visit the "Contact" page. There will also be links to their social media sites, which are as of now Facebook and Instagram.</p>

		<h2> 7. Minimum Requirements </h2>
		
		
			<p> We plan to fulfil the minimum requirements of Javascript
			 applications in this way: </p>
			 
			 <p> <em>Guttorm and Ellen </em> will be in charge of implementing: </p>
			 
			 <ol>
			 	<li>A Javascript function that will dynamically display artwork in
			 	a random fashion in a slideshow. Since Nan Nan's website is very visual, we would 
			 	like it to be as interactive and appealing as possible. The random 
			 	image display through Javascript will increase user's curiosity and interesty by 
				portraying a variety of different aspects of Nan Nan's artwork, Atutu Art School, 
				and the children.
			 	
			 	<li> A Javascript function that allows a pop-up window to display a larger 
			 	version of the thumbnail picture when clicked on. We will have many pictures
			 	of paintings and the school, so in order to decrease loading time and 
			 	not confuse the user, we will use 150px x 150px thumbnails, which the users will
			 	be able to click on to enlarge. The resulting larger picture will be 350px x 450px. 
				We plan to make it similar to Facebook's function for pictures and the blurred gray background.
			 </ol>
			 	
			 <p> <em>Trond and Birgit</em> will be in charge of implementing: </p>
			 
			 <ol>
			 	<li>A Javascript function for a roll over menu that will be provided on each
			 	page to allow easy access to every other page in the website. We do not want
			 	every link to appear constantly on the page, hence links of similar topics will
			 	appear under one heading that will hint the user to hover over. For example,
			 	the user can hover upon the "Atutu Art School" tab and the menu will roll down
			 	displaying atutu_aboutTheSchool.html, atutu_ChildrenArtwork.html and 
			 	atutu_volunteerAndDonate.html.
			 	
			 	<li>A Javascript that uses loops for arrays to display prices and artwork
			 	respectively. Nan Nan will be selling her artwork to potential customers 
			 	using the web page, so it is important for her to have easy control over 
			 	the price lists and art piece names and other relevant information such as
			 	dimensions and material in one place. 
			</ol>
			
			
			<p> As one of the pages include volunteer information, we hope to add a fifth 
			Javascript to display a volunteer form to acquire all the necessary information
			for Nan Nan easily and efficiently.</p>
